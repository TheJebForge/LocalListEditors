# Local List Editors

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that makes list editors be generated by local user instead of host, only useful in combination with [MyInspectors](https://github.com/art0007i/MyInspectors) mod.

### The mod has potential to prevent you from using custom tools that utilize ListEditor in some way in sessions where you're not the host. 
### If you're experiencing problems with them, disable the mod in [Neos Mod Settings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/NeosModSettings) or mod configs

## Eventuallyâ„¢
- Make the mod work with bag editors too

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [LocalListEditors.dll](https://github.com/TheJebForge/LocalListEditors/releases/latest/download/LocalListEditors.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
